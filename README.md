# INFO5100-Team-Assignment

## Application Engineering & Development â€“ Summer 2021
Due Date : July 8th, 2021 at 11:59 PM
### Delivery Format: A team of 3 students are required for this project (no exceptions)

The objective of this assignment is to instill in you the techniques for turning a design into a digital system for data collection, insight, as well as social impact. We want to use software engineering
design and programming techniques to improve the quality of education university setting anywhere in the world and hold people accountable for improving the quality of life for people through education, learning to learn, and feedback.

Your task to study ways to create a performance measurement solution to enable universities to
measure the quality of the education they deliver to their students. Quality here means keeping courses fresh and aligned with industry trends. The approach will be to look into how an educational system involving faculty, courses, and employers contribute to the professional growth of their graduates over a 5-year period. You must figure out ways to track the jobs and promotions graduates get over time and assign rankings accordingly. In addition, track the connection of courses and their relevance to graduates growth. Also, study the relationship between GPAs and industrial success (In other words, do grades matter?) Also, discuss how to apply your digital ideas and solutions to k-to-12 educational systems in the developing countries. 

One of your deliverables will be to design a dashboard that enables college and university administrators to compare the job performance of their students and academic units. 

One important question is to define your own ranking system of educational institutions especially for the developing world.

### Deliverables

1.	Running java code showing the implementation of a complete system at the department and college levels. 
2.	Presentation outlining your solution and implementation. 
3.	Sequence diagrams showing how to navigate the university object model to deliver performance metrics needed for performance and feedback. 
4.	An object model showing the changes to the university model to support the new capabilities. 
5.	This must include the additional methods and attributes required to deliver the results. 
6.	Investigate how we create digital education systems assuming a university is an intermediary (broker) between students and employers. Their brand is about credibility. How the implementation code will change based on this assumption? 
7.	Your application must enable the creation and update functions for any of the attributes of concern. 

### Note

You must figure out how to generate a lot of data for a complete configuration of your university system (including teachers, students, courses, employers, etc.). This will enable you to analyze and summarize the data. You might want to use the faker package to generate realistic data.
